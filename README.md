# Welcome to DecisionsDecisions!

This is Ruby on rails application that helps the user decide on a movie genre, food to eat, or a restaurant to go to.
"What should I eat?" is always the biggest question. Spending far too long scrolling through Netflix? Us too.
Somehow at this point, your brain just leaves you and you cannot decide what you want. Want someone else to do the choosing for you? Well, look no further. Using this app, you can submit a specific movie genre or cuisine and let the app give a suggestion based on those you submitted. You can also ‘add random movie/food’ and, you’ve guessed it, it will randomly select something for you to watch or eat!



* Ruby version
    ruby '2.6.1'

* Database creation
    • Utilized Yelp API for random restaurant suggestions.
    • Running Ruby on Rails with sqlite3 database for backend, SCSS, vanilla CSS, & bootstrap for frontend.

* Database initialization
    Run command **rails s** to startup the localhost.(http://localhost:3000/)
